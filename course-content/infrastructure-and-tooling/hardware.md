# Computing and GPUs

## Summary

* If you go the GPU round, there are a lot of **NVIDIA** cards to choose from \(Kepler, Maxwell, Pascal, Volta, Turing\).
* If you go with a cloud provider, **Amazon Web Services** and **Google Cloud Platform** are the heavyweights, while startups such as **Paperspace** and **Lambda Labs** are also viable options.
* If you work solo or in a startup, you should build or buy a 4x recent-architecture PC for model development. For model training, if you run many experiments, you can either buy shared server machines or use cloud instances.
* If you work in a large company, you are more likely to rely on cloud instances for both model development and model training, as they provide proper provisioning and infrastructure to handle failures.
